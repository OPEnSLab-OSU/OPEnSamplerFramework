.. begin_framework_brief

Lightweight, header-only modularized framework for embeded Arduino aplications. This
framework employ concepts and terminologies from finite-state-machine to provide
the client application with a maintainable code structure. Using FSM, the client
application is broken into a series of states `(KPState)` that implement lifecycle methods.
